# dnb-hugo-shortcodes

Shortcodes I use in multiple themes for Hugo

## How to use

This is a theme component. You can add it to your regular theme by adding it **LEFT** of the theme in your `config.toml`.

Old:

```
theme = ["mytheme"]
```

New:

```
theme = ["dnb-hugo-shortcodes", "mytheme"]
```

To override shortcodes just add a file in your own shortcode directory with the name you want to replace.

## Shortcodes

Documentation of the shortcodes this repository implements is forthcoming.
