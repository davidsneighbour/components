## DNB Hugo Component / Functions

This is a Hugo theme component with helper functions for several other components.

### Installing

First enable modules in your own repository:

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/username/reponame
```

Then add this module to your required modules in config.toml.

```toml
[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/dnb-hugo/components/functions"
```

The next time you run `hugo` it will download the latest version of the module.

### Working principle

While being named `functions` this component adds merely partials that return values. In these partials calculations are done, so we might un-nerdily call them functions. 

### Available Functions

#### getReadingTime

```gotemplate
{{ $readingtime := partial "func/getReadingTime" . }}
```

- Context: a dictionary containing at least `.Content` to be counted. 
- Returns: a dictionary with `minutes` (int), `seconds` (int), `words` (int)
- Configuration options in `data/functions/readingtime/config.toml`:
  - wordsperminute (default 220.0) - Words that are read per minute. This must be a float value, not an integer! (no quotation marks and at least ending in .0 to typecast it as float)
  - minutesandseconds (default true) - should the function return minutes and seconds or only minutes (the latter will be rounded up for the seconds in addition)
  
### Update

```shell
# update this module
hugo mod get -u github.com/dnb-hugo/components/functions 
# update all modules
hugo mod get -u # 
```
